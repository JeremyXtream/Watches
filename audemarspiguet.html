				<p class="parainfo">
					Audemars Piguet is a highly regarded watch manufacturer. The company is best known for introducing the Royal Oak wristwatch in 1972, which helped the brand rise to prominence within the watchmaking industry.

					Let me show you my two most favourite AP watches!

					It turned Audemars Piguet into one of the most successful watch brands in the world. Released in 1972, the Royal Oak was the first stainless steel watch marketed as a luxury piece. What I find very beautiful about the Royyal Oak watches is their unique bracelet, which is usually two-toned and very beautiful to look at.

					The Audemars Piguet Royal Openworked Double Balance Wheel, features a 45 hour power reserve and is made in stainless steel and rose gold. The speciality of AP is that they were the ones to invent a skeleton watch back in 1946.
