					The Day-Date made its debut in 1956. Available only in 18 ct gold or platinum, it was the first wristwatch chronometer to display the date and the day of the week spelt out in full in windows on the dial. Its also known as the Presidential watch.

					Launched in 1953, the Submariner was the first divers’ wristwatch waterproof to a depth of 100 metres (330 feet). This was the second watch in the mastery of waterproofness, following the invention of the Oyster, the world’s first waterproof wristwatch, in 1926.

					The Sky-Dweller is a distinctive watch and is characterized by its second time zone display on an off-centre disc on the dial. The speciality of this watch is the annual calendar, that is based on a mechanism called SAROS, and its genius lies in its simplicity.
